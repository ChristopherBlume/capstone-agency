## Backend

To start the local flask-server make sure to activate a virtual environment and install the requirements.txt with the following command:

cd backend
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Second, define the environment variables inside the backend directory:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Finally start the flask server:

```bash
flask run
```

If you dont want to use the Frontend to generate a auth0 token, please use the following link:

## Frontend

To run the local development server run:

```bash
cd frontend
ng serve --open
```

A new chrome window/tab should now open and display the application. Use the Sign In Button to start.

## Testing

Make sure to change in the backend directory to perform unit-tests:

It should run 19 tests.
